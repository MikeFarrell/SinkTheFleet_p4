# SinkTheFleet_p4

I'm pretty much out of time.  I put in confim each ship and the auto setships().  the 
auto thing is slow but it works.. Added the option in sinkTheFleet.cpp too. 
I uploaded my whole solution dir to canvas group files too.  it's Vader_P4_3.zip
Just needs formatting for printing and headers

I am assuming that you guys are working on this still. I am finishing a submission folder with a working version of this program as a backup in case you dont finish. Working on the test plan now -JW
