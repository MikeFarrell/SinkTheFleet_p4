# SinkTheFleet_p4

I put up some saved grid files for testing, smallGrid1 and 2, and largeGrid1 and 2. 
The load/save part works now.  Added some stuff to the sinkTheFleet constructor.
I moved the 'select grid size' to the very beginning of game because the sinkTheFleet
constructor needs it. 

There's still some problem with setShips() and validLocation(), you can overwrite a 
position right now.. Then it's supposed to confirm the location with user for each ship. 

DETAILS ARE IN THE "WORKING ON COMMENTS" COMMIT
